Summary: I review a new monster flavor (again)

So recently I saw some posting about the Monster Vice Guava flavor, and I wasnt able to find one immidiately but i saw one in a corner store earlier today and, well, its Haloween, i might as well post. 

so visually the can makes it painfully apparent that Monster knows their modern demographics - trans women. its a very pale blue with geometric synthwavey symbols in pink. the lid cap is a bright pink. 

drinkm itself is what ccan only be described as "synthwave pink". it surprisedc me coming out of the can, as i was expecting a pale blue, but it makes sense with the cap color. 

on the olfactory front, very tropical., sorta just smells like every other tropical monster flavor

taste-wise, its guava. not much else to say. my wife says shes not very happy with the carbonation in concert with the guava, but i find it perfectly acceptable.
