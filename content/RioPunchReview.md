Summary: I review a new (to me? id if its truly new) monster flavor, Rio Punch


I let it reach roughly room temperature for the first taste, as this is unfortunately how i drink a lot of my monster. Rio punch is a carbonated juice monster - not my favorite category, i feel the juice can speak for itself without the carbonation - initial impression of taste is like when i mix together all the skittles in a small bag. 

aftertaste is something like artificial grape, but the front flavors are almost entirely non-grape. 

poured into a glass with ice for the rest. color is an orange-pink, definitely has grape tones to it, also with perhaps mango and peach, or some other stone fruit.
