Summary: I review a new (to me? id if its truly new) monster flavor, Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red

Encountered this flavor at the same place as Rio Punch, i think this place must just keep their stock more up to date. can is very interesting, very glad i grabbed it for my collection. tastes grapefruity - carbonated, which i like in ultras - but yes the primary flavor is grapefruit, which is very interesting. havednt had a monster that had a distinct citrus before, just the vague citrusy feel they all have. nothing really else to say, i like it, bc i like grapefruit. if you like grapefruit id give it a try, but if you dont its probably not worth your time.
