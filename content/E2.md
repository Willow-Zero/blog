Summary: My journey so far with polyphasic sleep 

My real introduction to polyphasic sleep was [NoBoilerplate's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuizzRCALCU) on the topic. I had heard about it from CGP Grey, if i remember correctly, but hadnt felt the desire to pursue it then. 

With the aid of the polyphasic sleep wiki's discord, I decided on everyman 2, with [this napchart in particular](https://napchart.com/snapshot/ilwUYKbwl), taking into account my classes.

this is going to be continually updated, as a sleep log. 

day 1: 
had a hard time getting out of bed so early, and didnt get much sleep during my naps

day 2: 
another hard time getting out of bed, and same on the naps

day 3: 
a third rough time getting out of bed. im waking up with my alarm but its not getting me up and out of bed. i think i need a new strategy. will try phone across the room tomorrow night. 

NOTE: This project is on pause. i got sick with food poisoning and crashed and burned out of the schedule. id been oversleeping and started undersleeping, and it was a whole mess. in rrecovery now, may return to this project later
