Summary: reviewing stories again

another round of retroactive rankings



# The Magnus Archives

is a podcast distributed by rusty quill entertainent under a creative commons attribution non-commercial share-alike 4.0 international license. its really good, has an overarching plot that has changed how i analyze my own fears. im going to leave it here, better than genesis, under wake, im going to come back and rate individual episodes when i do my relisten

# Nanook of the North

a classic silent movie, arguably the first documentary, about an inuit man named nanook. its all lies. watched it for a class about imperialism. it takes the lowest position.  

# [SCP-6999](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6999)

is one of the few skips that brought me to tears. i wont spoil it. i highly reccomend. better than magnus, just bc magnus has a couple misses, and 6999 is a single story and therefore 100% hits.

# Arc of a Scythe

is a series about death and the fascist reigime that derives from its destruction. its really good. Toll>Thunderhead>Scythe imo but theyre really close so im leaving them all together. ill put it just under Wake.




that leaves the list as
