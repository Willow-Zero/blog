  <p>So. ive been having a real timementally lately. the internet is bad for me, in the form i interact with it in. so. im withdrawing from some spaces, and reworking how i interact. </p>
<h1>step 1: discord</h1>
<p>im in too many discord servers. so im thinning them out. trying to keep it to places i am active or want to be active, shoving any tech support servers into a folder, so i can access them but dont need to see them and be overwhelmed</p>
<h1>step 2: messaging</h1>
<p>so. i dont talk to people enough. ill forget to chat with someone for like months on end. so i want to unify my messaging into one program in order to better manage my messaging. im using pidgin for this, but it may require coding up some plugins for it, keep an eye on this space to see if i end up going through with that</p>
<h1>step 3: content</h1>
<p>content is bad. so im going to stop using most content-based services. no more youtube, no more reccomendations feed. im going to work through my watch later list, and then set up youtube rss feeds for my favorite channels, to keep up to date. im also going to finally set up my ipod video (ill probably post abt it at some point) so i dont have to use spotify anymore. </p>
<p>well, this is basically a to do list and a promise to myself, so uhhhhh. hope that works out. </p>
