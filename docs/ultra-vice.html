  <p>So recently I saw some posting about the Monster Vice Guava flavor, and I wasnt able to find one immidiately but i saw one in a corner store earlier today and, well, its Haloween, i might as well post. </p>
<p>so visually the can makes it painfully apparent that Monster knows their modern demographics - trans women. its a very pale blue with geometric synthwavey symbols in pink. the lid cap is a bright pink. </p>
<p>drinkm itself is what ccan only be described as "synthwave pink". it surprisedc me coming out of the can, as i was expecting a pale blue, but it makes sense with the cap color. </p>
<p>on the olfactory front, very tropical., sorta just smells like every other tropical monster flavor</p>
<p>taste-wise, its guava. not much else to say. my wife says shes not very happy with the carbonation in concert with the guava, but i find it perfectly acceptable. </p>
